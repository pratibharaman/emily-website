                Hi, I'm Emily! I'm a Pediatric Occupational Therapist supporting
                children 1-12 years old out of Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York.
                I utilize a sensory-based, neuro-affirming, and client-centered
                approach in therapy.
                <p>
                  I graduated with my MA in Occupational Therapy from Boston
                  University in 2018, working as a pediatrics occupational
                  therapist in NYC since. I also co-facilitate Neuro-Lit, a book
                  club that aims to create a supportive and inclusive space for
                  community members of all neurotypes to better understand
                  neurodiversity, challenge assumptions, and expand
                  perspectives. Meaningful occupations to me include reading,
                  painting, hiking, and exploring the many restaurants and
                  museums of NYC.
