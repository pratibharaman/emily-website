            <p><i>What is Occupational Therapy (OT)?</i>
            </br>
            OT is a form of therapy that aims to improve a 
            person's ability to engage in their meaningful 
            activities of daily life. OT supports clients in a 
            variety of settings, including but not limited to schools, 
            hospitals, sensory gyms, rehabilitation centers, and clients' homes. 
            My OT services aim to support children in their engagement 
            in their daily activities, including but not limited to academic tasks, 
            self-care tasks, and play, with an aim of increasing meaningful activity 
            participation, developing confidence and competence, and greater independence. 
            Sessions may address fine motor skills, visual motor skills, 
            and sensory processing and regulation abilities, activity modifications, 
            environmental modifications, and caregiver education.</p>

            I work with children ages 1-12 years old.</p>
            <p><i>Where do you provide OT Services?</i>
            </br>
            I provide OT in Manhattan and Brooklyn, New York. 
            I provide sessions in families' homes and community spaces, 
            such as parks and libraries.</p>
            <p><i>When are services available?</i>

            <p><i>How long are OT sessions?</i>
            </br>
            Sessions tend to be 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or 60 minutes long. 
            The recommended session length is determined in the OT evaluation.</p>
